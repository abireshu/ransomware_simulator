#  Ransomware Simulation ‚Äì A File Encryption-Decryption Demonstrator

A Python-based ethical ransomware simulation built with Streamlit, this project mimics real-world ransomware behavior such as file encryption, ransom messages, and payment prompts ‚Äî designed purely for cybersecurity awareness. What sets this simulation apart is its ability to trigger encryption **when a user attempts to open a seemingly harmless file**, emulating realistic ransomware infection tactics.

## üßæ General Info

This ransomware simulator demonstrates the lifecycle of a ransomware attack‚Äîfrom encryption to decryption‚Äîusing strong AES-based encryption. The application includes a GUI built in Streamlit to show how attackers might lure users and demand ransom through fake Bitcoin wallets. It‚Äôs safe, controlled, and ideal for educational and training purposes in cybersecurity.

## üì¶ Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher

Install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` contents:

```txt
streamlit==1.35.0
cryptography==42.0.5
```

---

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abireshu/ransomware_simulator.git
cd ransomware_simulator
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the application**:

```bash
python -m streamlit run home.py
```

4. **Simulate**:

* Choose a file ‚Üí File gets encrypted
* Ransom note appears and click ok
* Click "Go to Payment"
* After mock payment, click "I've paid to decrypt the file

## üîç What Makes It Stand Out

‚úÖ **Realistic Trigger Mechanism**
Encryption starts when a user *attempts to open a file*, simulating how ransomware exploits curiosity or negligence.

‚úÖ **Simulated Bitcoin Ransom Portal**
Includes a dummy BTC wallet address to show how real ransomware demands payment anonymously.

‚úÖ **PBKDF2HMAC Key Derivation with Salt**
Ensures secure and non-reversible key generation, in line with [NIST](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-132.pdf) guidelines.

‚úÖ **Educational Purpose Only**
All encryption and decryption happens locally with user control ‚Äî no actual ransomware behavior like file deletion or spreading.

‚úÖ **Streamlit GUI for Accessibility**
A simple, clean interface suitable for demonstrations, workshops, and presentations.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

| Problem                | Solution                                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `salt.bin not found`   | Ensure key generation is run before encrypting        |
| GUI doesn't open       | Run: `streamlit run gui.py` from project root         |
| File doesn't decrypt   | Double-check password and salt consistency            |
| subprocess error       | Use `["python", "encrypt.py", "file_path"]` syntax    |
| GUI input isn't hidden | Use Streamlit's `st.text_input(..., type="password")` |

## ‚ùì FAQs

**Q: Is this real ransomware?**
A: No, it‚Äôs a safe, controlled simulation for learning and awareness.

**Q: Why is Bitcoin used in the simulation?**
A: BTC is commonly used in real ransomware due to its anonymity, decentralization, and irreversible nature ‚Äî making the simulation more authentic.

**Q: What happens if I lose the salt or password?**
A: The file will not be decrypted ‚Äî which mimics real-world risk in secure encryption practices.

**Q: Can I use this to simulate attacks on others?**
A: Absolutely not. This is strictly for ethical and educational use only.

## üß† Recommendations for Improvement

* Add countdown timer to simulate urgency
* Integrate fake email alert system
* Add decryption success report with timestamp
* Log user actions for awareness training
* Improve cross-platform compatibility for Windows/Mac/Linux
